# Development Workflow Summary

## Configuration Established ✅

This project now has a **mandatory development workflow** for all feature requests made to Claude.

## Key Files Created

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Comprehensive workflow documentation
2. **`.clauderc`** - JSON configuration with quality gates
3. **Updated `README.md`** - References new workflow requirements

## Mandatory Process for Every Feature Request

### 🔄 The Process
1. **Branch Creation** - `feature/[descriptive-name]`
2. **Implementation** - Build the requested feature
3. **Self-Testing** - **Run tool on its own codebase** (dogfooding)
4. **Feedback Implementation** - Address ALL review findings
5. **Quality Assurance** - Verify no regressions
6. **Documentation** - Update README/help as needed
7. **Commit & Push** - Professional commit with co-authorship

### 🧪 Required Testing Commands
```bash
# Primary dogfooding test
node ./bin/run.js review -m local -l claude -o html -b main

# Verification tests
node ./bin/run.js --help
node ./bin/run.js list-llms
node ./bin/run.js review --help

# Interactive test
node ./bin/run.js
```

### 🎯 Quality Gates
- **Blocking Issues**: MUST fix
- **Critical Suggestions**: MUST implement
- **Performance Issues**: MUST address
- **Security Concerns**: MUST fix
- **Backwards Compatibility**: MUST maintain

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent Quality** - Every feature is self-reviewed and improved
✅ **Dogfooding** - Tool tests itself, ensuring reliability  
✅ **No Regressions** - Mandatory verification of existing functionality
✅ **Professional Standards** - Comprehensive documentation and testing
✅ **Feedback Loop** - Continuous improvement through self-analysis

## Example Success Pattern

When this workflow is followed correctly:
```
🔍 Comparing feature/new-feature (abc123) with main (def456)
✔ Found X changed files, diff size: Y characters
✔ File context prepared, total size: Z characters
✔ CLAUDE code review completed in N.Ns
```

Then implement all feedback, test again, and merge clean code to main.

**This configuration is now ACTIVE and will be enforced for all future feature development.**
