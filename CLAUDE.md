# Claude Code Development Workflow

## Project Configuration for Feature Development

This document establishes the mandatory workflow for all feature requests and improvements to the GitLab MR Reviewer project.

## Required Workflow for Every Feature Request

### 1. Branch Creation
- **MUST** create a new feature branch for each request
- Branch naming convention: `feature/[descriptive-name]`
- Example: `feature/add-config-file-support`, `feature/improve-error-handling`

### 2. Application Understanding & Documentation
- **MANDATORY**: Build and maintain understanding of the application architecture
- When working on any file for the first time, generate a lightweight summary of:
  - What the file does (primary purpose and functionality)
  - Key exports/functions/classes it provides
  - How it fits into the overall application architecture
  - Dependencies and relationships to other files
- Store these summaries as comments at the beginning of this workflow for future reference
- Use this knowledge base to efficiently locate functionality when needed
- Update summaries when making significant changes to existing files

### 3. Implementation Process
- Implement the requested feature or improvement
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly requested otherwise
- Update documentation (README.md) when adding new functionality

### 4. Self-Testing Requirement
- **MANDATORY**: Test the implemented feature using the tool itself
- Run the GitLab MR Reviewer on its own codebase with the new changes
- Command to use: `node ./bin/run.js review -m local -l [claude|gemini] -o [html|cli] -b main`
- Generate both HTML and CLI outputs to verify functionality

### 5. Feedback Analysis & Implementation
- Analyze all feedback from the self-review
- Implement **ALL** blocking issues and critical suggestions
- Address performance, security, and maintainability concerns
- Fix any bugs or issues identified during self-testing

### 6. Quality Assurance
- Ensure all existing functionality still works
- Test interactive mode with inquirer prompts
- Verify spinners and loading animations function correctly
- Run linting if available: `npm run lint`

### 7. Documentation Updates
- Update README.md for new features or changed behavior
- Add usage examples for new functionality
- Update help text and command descriptions as needed

### 8. Final Commit & Push
- **MANDATORY**: Run `npm run lint` before committing to ensure code quality
- Create comprehensive commit message following existing patterns
- Include co-authorship: `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- Push to remote repository
- Ready for merge to main

## Testing Commands for Self-Review

### Local Review (Required)
```bash
# HTML output test
node ./bin/run.js review -m local -l claude -o html -b main

# CLI output test  
node ./bin/run.js review -m local -l gemini -o cli -b main
```

### Interactive Mode Test
```bash
# Test prompts and user interaction
node ./bin/run.js
```

### Command Verification
```bash
# Test all commands work
node ./bin/run.js --help
node ./bin/run.js review --help
node ./bin/run.js list-llms
node ./bin/run.js setup
```

## Compliance Requirements

### For Every Feature Request, Claude Must:
1. ‚úÖ Create a dedicated feature branch
2. ‚úÖ Build understanding of relevant application files and architecture
3. ‚úÖ Implement the requested functionality  
4. ‚úÖ Test using the tool on its own codebase
5. ‚úÖ Analyze and implement ALL self-review feedback
6. ‚úÖ Verify no regressions in existing functionality
7. ‚úÖ Update documentation appropriately
8. ‚úÖ Run `npm run lint` before committing
9. ‚úÖ Provide comprehensive commit message
10. ‚úÖ Push branch and prepare for main merge

### Success Criteria
- All self-review feedback implemented
- No blocking issues remaining
- All existing tests/functionality preserved
- Documentation updated
- Clean, professional commit history

## Example Self-Testing Output
When testing is successful, you should see output like:
```
üîç Comparing feature/new-feature (abc123) with main (def456)
‚úî Found X changed files, diff size: Y characters
‚úî File context prepared, total size: Z characters  
‚úî CLAUDE code review completed in N.Ns
```

## Enforcement
This workflow is **MANDATORY** for all feature development. Any deviation from this process should be flagged and corrected before proceeding.

## Application Knowledge Base

### File Summaries
<!-- Add lightweight summaries of files as you work on them -->
<!-- Format: **file/path**: Purpose - Key exports/functions - Architecture role - Dependencies -->

---

**Note**: This configuration ensures high code quality, thorough testing, consistent development practices, and comprehensive application understanding for the GitLab MR Reviewer project.
